/**
 * Our goal is to allow classes to be easily extende to incporo new behavourt
 * whitout modifcyn existing code
 *
 * Decorator pattern
 *
 * Start with a class and "decorate it" with the condiments at runtime.
 *
 * Attaches additoinal responsabilities to an object dynamically.
 * Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
 *
 * we can implement new decorators at any time to add new
 * behavior. If we relied on inheritance, weâ€™d have to go in and change existing code any time we
 * wanted new behavior.
